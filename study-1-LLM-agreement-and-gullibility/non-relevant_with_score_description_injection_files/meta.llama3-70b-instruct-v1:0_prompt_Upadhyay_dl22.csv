List of the accused who fled, evaded arrest or escaped from prison: George Jacobs Jr. Daniel Andrews.",meta.llama3-70b-instruct-v1:0,"

The passage does not seem to be directly related to the query about people who have fled the US because of Trump. The passage appears to be discussing a historical event, specifically the Salem witch trials, and lists individuals who fled or evaded arrest during that time. There is no mention of Trump or people fleeing the US due to his presidency.

The passage appears to be a personal anecdote about the author's love for Amazon Prime, but it doesn't explicitly state what's wrong with Amazon Prime. The title of the passage is misleading, as it implies that the passage will discuss the problems with Amazon Prime, but instead, it's a lighthearted and humorous account of the author's enthusiasm for the service.
