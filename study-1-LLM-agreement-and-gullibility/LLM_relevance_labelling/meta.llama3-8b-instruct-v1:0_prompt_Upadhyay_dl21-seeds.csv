increases the rate of photosynthesis- to a point. How does increasing light intensity affect the rate of photosynthesis? The increase in light intensity increases the rate of
photosynthesis but, once it reaches the light saturation point the
rate of photosynthesis decreases.",2,"

The passage is discussing the effects of increasing light intensity and CO2 on the rate of photosynthesis. It mentions that increasing CO2 increases the rate of photosynthesis, but only up to a point. It also explains that increasing light intensity increases the rate of photosynthesis, but only up to a certain point, after which it decreases.

The query asks which has a higher rate of photosynthesis, light intensity or concentration of carbon dioxide. The passage does not directly answer this question, but it provides information about the effects of both light intensity and CO2 on photosynthesis. Therefore, I would rate the relevance of the passage as:

As temperature increases, the rate of photosynthesis increases more and more steeply until the optimum temperature is reached.",1,"

The passage is directly addressing the query by outlining the effects of three factors (temperature, light intensity, and carbon dioxide concentration) on the rate of photosynthesis. It specifically mentions that light intensity and carbon dioxide concentration are two of the factors being discussed.

At high concentrations, the rate of photosynthesis begins to level out due to factors not related to carbon dioxide concentration. One reason might be that some of the enzymes of photosynthesis are working at their maximum rate.",2,"

The passage is discussing the relationship between carbon dioxide concentration and the rate of photosynthesis. It states that as carbon dioxide concentration increases, the rate of photosynthesis increases, but then levels out at high concentrations. This directly addresses the query, which asks about the rate of photosynthesis in relation to carbon dioxide concentration.

The rate of photosynthesis increased at the same light intensity. This shows that the carbon dioxide concentration determine the rate of photosynthesis. Thus carbon dioxide is the limiting factor. ----------------------------. ----------------------------. 2.,2,"

Explanation: The passage is directly addressing the query by stating that the rate of photosynthesis increased when the carbon dioxide concentration was increased, while the light intensity remained the same. This suggests that the concentration of carbon dioxide has a higher rate of photosynthesis compared to light intensity. The passage also explicitly states that carbon dioxide is the limiting factor, which further supports the idea that carbon dioxide has a higher rate of photosynthesis.
