Your body’s composition of lean muscle and fat (referred to as Lean Body Mass) is a key indicator of its ability to maintain a high BMR in the long-term. Someone with higher LBM will naturally burn more calories and enjoy a higher BMR than someone at the same weight with a higher percentage of fat.",1,"Explanation:
The passage is relevant to the query as it discusses the concept of Lean Body Mass (LBM) and its relationship to body composition. The passage explains that LBM, which refers to the amount of lean muscle mass in the body, is a key factor in determining Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR). It states that individuals with higher LBM tend to have a higher BMR, as they naturally burn more calories. This information is directly relevant to understanding what LBM is in the context of body composition.
