2082,At about what age do adults normally begin to lose bone mass?,msmarco_passage_15_590358302,Graph Showing Relationship Between Age and Bone Mass. Bone density peaks at about 30 years of age. Women lose bone mass more rapidly than men. Figure 2 shows that women lose bone mass more quickly than men starting at about 50 years of age.,2,"The query asks about the age at which adults normally begin to lose bone mass. The passage provides relevant information by stating that bone density peaks at about 30 years of age, which implies that bone mass loss would begin after this peak. Additionally, it mentions that women start losing bone mass more rapidly than men starting at about 50 years of age. This information is directly related to the query and provides a clear answer.

In adults, bone density may increase 1-2 %, but this increase occurs only in the area of the skeleton that is stressed and this improved density will be lost if the loading exercise isn’t continued.",2,"The query is asking about the age at which adults normally begin to lose bone mass. The passage discusses how physical activity affects bone mass after the age of 25, mentioning that overall bone mass cannot be increased dramatically through physical activity alone after this age. However, it does not directly address when adults begin to lose bone mass.

The passage implies that significant changes in bone mass dynamics occur around the age of 25, but it does not explicitly state that this is when bone loss begins. Instead, it focuses on the limitations of increasing bone density through physical activity in adults.

Therefore, while the passage is somewhat related to the topic of bone mass and age, it does not provide a clear or direct answer to the query about when adults begin to lose bone mass.

The First Battle of Manassas, or Bull Run, fought on July 21, 1861, was the first major battle of the American Civil War (1861–1865). United States president Abraham Lincoln—under pressure from the public that urged the army “On to Richmond!”—went against the advice of his aging general-in-chief Winfield Scott and ordered an attack.",1,"The query asks for the specific date and location of the Battle of Manassas. The passage provides this information by stating that the First Battle of Manassas, also known as Bull Run, was fought on July 21, 1861. This directly answers the ""when"" part of the query.
