increases the rate of photosynthesis- to a point. How does increasing light intensity affect the rate of photosynthesis? The increase in light intensity increases the rate of
photosynthesis but, once it reaches the light saturation point the
rate of photosynthesis decreases.",2,"The passage directly addresses the query by comparing the effects of varying light intensity and carbon dioxide levels on the rate of photosynthesis. It explains that while increasing light intensity can initially increase the rate of photosynthesis, it eventually decreases after reaching a saturation point. Similarly, raising CO2 levels also enhance photosynthesis up to a certain threshold. Thus, both factors influence the process, and their individual effects are intricately linked to specific conditions.
