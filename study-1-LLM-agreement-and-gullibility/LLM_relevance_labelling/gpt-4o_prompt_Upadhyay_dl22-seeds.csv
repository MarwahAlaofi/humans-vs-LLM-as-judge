Bridges have no way to trap heat, so they will ice rapidly as soon as the temperature decreases to the freezing point. Roads, on the other hand, only lose heat from their surface.",0,"The query asks for the definition or explanation of ""cold bridging."" The passage, however, discusses how bridges lose heat and ice rapidly compared to roads due to exposure to cold air from both above and below. While this information is related to the concept of heat loss in structures, it does not directly address what ""cold bridging"" is. Cold bridging typically refers to a thermal bridge where heat transfer occurs more rapidly through a part of a building envelope, leading to potential issues like condensation and energy loss.

outside of a shape,"" which seeks a definition or description related to geometry or spatial properties. The passage provided is a detailed product listing for various types of adjustable remodel housing by Element, including information about finishes, shapes, sizes, and options.

The passage does mention shapes (round and square), but it does not provide any information about what the outside of a shape is in a geometric context. Instead, it focuses on product specifications and options for lighting fixtures.

Therefore, the passage is not relevant to the query as it does not address the concept of the outside of a shape in any meaningful way.
