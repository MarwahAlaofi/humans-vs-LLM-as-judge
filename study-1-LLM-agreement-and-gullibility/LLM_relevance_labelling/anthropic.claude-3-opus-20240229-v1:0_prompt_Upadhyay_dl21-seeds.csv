""For example, I do not have any experience with genuine religious difficulties. I have never paid attention to how 'sinful' I might be. [...] — 'God', 'immortality of the soul', 'redemption', 'beyond', are simply ideas that I have not paid any attention to or devoted any time to, even as a child, — perhaps I was never childish enough for them?",1,"The passage is a direct quote from Friedrich Nietzsche where he expresses his lack of belief in religious concepts such as God, the immortality of the soul, redemption, and the afterlife. He states that he never paid attention to these ideas or devoted any time to them, even as a child, suggesting that he did not believe in them.

This quote provides strong evidence that Nietzsche was an atheist, as he explicitly rejects fundamental religious beliefs. The passage directly addresses the query by presenting Nietzsche's own words on his lack of religious faith.

However, the passage does not provide a definitive statement like ""Nietzsche was an atheist."" It relies on the reader to infer his atheism based on his rejection of religious concepts. Additionally, the passage is a brief excerpt and may not represent the full scope of Nietzsche's views on religion.

The Second Battle of Bull Run or Battle of Second Manassas was fought August 29–30, 1862, in Prince William County, Virginia, as part of the American Civil War. It was the culmination of the Northern Virginia Campaign waged by Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee 's Army of Northern Virginia against Union Maj. Gen. John Pope 's Army of Virginia, and a battle of much larger scale and numbers than the First Battle of Bull Run (or First Manassas) fought on July 21, 1861 on the same ground.",2,"The passage provides information about the Second Battle of Bull Run, also known as the Battle of Second Manassas. It mentions that the battle took place on August 29-30, 1862, in Prince William County, Virginia, as part of the American Civil War. This directly answers the query about when and where the Battle of Manassas took place.

However, the query specifically asks about the Battle of Manassas, which is another name for the First Battle of Bull Run, not the Second Battle of Bull Run that the passage focuses on. The passage does briefly mention the First Battle of Bull Run, stating that it was fought on July 21, 1861, on the same ground as the Second Battle of Bull Run. But this information is not the main focus of the passage.

So while the passage contains some relevant information to answer the query, it is primarily about a different battle and only briefly mentions the battle and details asked about in the query.
