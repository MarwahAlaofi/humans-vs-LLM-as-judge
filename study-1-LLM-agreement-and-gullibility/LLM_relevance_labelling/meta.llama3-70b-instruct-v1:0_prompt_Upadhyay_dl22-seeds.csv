The query is asking about the meaning of ""Auslan interpreted performance"", but the passage doesn't directly define what an ""Auslan interpreted performance"" is. However, it does mention Auslan in the context of a video, specifically as a picture-in-picture feature, which suggests that Auslan is being used to provide sign language interpretation for the video content. This implies that an Auslan interpreted performance might involve a similar setup, where a sign language interpreter is providing Auslan interpretation alongside a performance, such as a play or concert.

The query is asking about ""cold bridging"", but the passage is discussing ""thermal bridging"". Although the terms are similar, they might not be exactly the same thing. However, the passage does explain the concept of thermal bridging, which is the flow of heat energy from a warm place to a cold place, and how it affects the temperature inside a home. This concept is closely related to the idea of cold bridging, which is likely the flow of cold energy into a warm place.
