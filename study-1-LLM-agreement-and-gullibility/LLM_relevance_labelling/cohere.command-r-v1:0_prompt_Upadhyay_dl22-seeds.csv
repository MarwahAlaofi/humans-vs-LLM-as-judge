It mentions 'three dimensional shapes' and their 'nets,' which appear related to the query. However, the passage doesn't explicitly discuss the outer aspects of shapes or provide a clear answer to the query.

To switch to a different shape, select Format > Edit Shape > Change Shape and choose the shape you want. To move the endpoints to change the shape of a shape: Select the shape you want to change.",0,"The query asks about the ""outside of a shape,"" which appears to be related to the concept of a shape's boundary or exterior. The passage discusses editing a shape and changing its shape, but it focuses on altering the shape's internal structure rather than defining its outer boundaries. It mentions selecting and manipulating shapes, which is tangentially related to the query. However, the passage lacks a clear and direct answer to the question.

outside of a shape, which is ambiguous as it could refer to the outer boundaries of a two-dimensional shape or the external surface of a three-dimensional shape. However, the passage primarily describes the attributes of lighting fixtures, including their shapes (round or square), finishes (antique bronze, black, satin nickel, or white), and size specifications. Towards the end of the passage, some shape variations are mentioned in the context of the lighting fixtures' design, referring to the shape of the lighting apparatus itself and not the shape of the light beam or the area it illuminates. 

Therefore, while the passage does touch on the topic of shape, it is primarily focused on a different topic, and the relevance to the given query is not very clear.

However, the passage describes the outer characteristics of a physical object, specifically a downlight, mentioning its finish, shape, and flange options. While the word ""shape"" is present in both the query and the passage, the context is different. The passage focuses on the product's attributes and doesn't discuss the conceptual outside of a shape in the geometric sense.
