The passage is discussing various medical terms, including ""splenomegaly"" which means enlargement of the spleen, and ""adrenocortical"" which means pertaining to the adrenal cortex. The query is asking about the meaning of ""s/p"" in a medical context.

The passage does not explicitly define what ""s/p"" means, but it does provide definitions for other medical terms. However, it does mention ""s/p"" in the context of ""adrenocortical"" which is a medical term. This suggests that ""s/p"" might be an abbreviation or shorthand for a medical term.
