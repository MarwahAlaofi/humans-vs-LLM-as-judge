While this phrase contains the words ""define"" and ""unstop"" from the query, it does not actually provide a definition for the word ""unstop."" The passage is using the word ""unstop"" in a metaphorical sense related to healing the deaf, but it does not explain the meaning of the word itself.

The passage seems to be about the limits of people considered ""high and worthy,"" and it includes a quote that mentions healing of the blind, deaf, lame, and mute. However, it does not directly address the definition of the specific word ""unstop.""
