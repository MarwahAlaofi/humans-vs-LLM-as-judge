The query is asking about what David W. Taylor is known for, but the passage is talking about David Berkowitz, also known as the Son of Sam and the 44-Caliber Killer. The passage mentions ""David"" and ""Taylor"" separately, but they are not referring to the same person. The passage is actually discussing David Berkowitz's journey of faith and his life in prison, which has no connection to David W. Taylor.

The query is asking about the age of the Elephant Man when he died, but the passage seems to be providing information about elephants in general. The passage mentions the size and weight of the largest elephant, as well as the age of the oldest elephant in history, but it does not specifically mention the Elephant Man.

However, there is a sentence in the passage that seems out of place: ""how old was the elephant man when he died"" (sentence 04). This sentence appears to be a repetition of the query, but it is not providing an answer. It's possible that this sentence was mistakenly included in the passage or is a typo.

Given this, I would categorize the relevance of the passage to the query as 1, because while it seems related to the query, it does not provide a clear answer.

The query is asking about the age of the Elephant Man when he died, but the passage doesn't seem to be directly related to the Elephant Man. However, it does mention an ""old elephant"" and provides information about its age at the time of death, which is 86 years old.
